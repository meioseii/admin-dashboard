# Admin Dashboard Project

This project is an admin dashboard assigned by The Odin Project as part of their Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.

Main objective was achieved; build a full dashboard design using grid.

I followed the layout that was given but I designed it my own way.

If you want to test it out, here's the live preview: https://meioseii.github.io/admin-dashboard/
